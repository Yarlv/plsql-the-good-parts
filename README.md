PL/SQL: The Good Parts, a presentation about the nice features of Oracle's database programming language

Somewhat inspired by Douglas Crockford's "Javascript: The Good Parts" presentation, this is an overview of features you should consider if you want to maximize your enjoyment of programming in the Oracle Database. Also, this is not an exhaustive list of all features, it's simply the ones I personally use frequently.

Note that unlike Javascript, I don't consider PL/SQL to have too many "bad parts" or bizarre quirks. There's a lot of good stuff, hence the title! :-)
